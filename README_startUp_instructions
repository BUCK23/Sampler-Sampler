# You need to edit the config file that determines what the x-session does on boot.

# Use nano to open the file:

`sudo nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart`

# On a new line at the bottom of the file add:

`@bash /*path*/*to*/startUp.sh`

# e.g. in our set up:

`@bash /home/pi/startUp.sh`

# ctrl+x to save file
# reboot to test.
